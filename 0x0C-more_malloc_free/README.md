## Introduction

In this project, we dive deeper into memory allocation and deallocation using `malloc` and `free`. We explore more advanced concepts and techniques related to dynamic memory management in the C programming language.

The project includes various tasks that allow us to practice and reinforce our understanding of these concepts. Each task involves writing C functions that allocate memory dynamically, manipulate data structures, and release memory appropriately using `free`. These tasks cover topics such as multidimensional arrays, strings, command-line arguments, and more.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- gcc 4.8.4
- All C files were compiled using the `gcc` compiler with the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`.

## Project Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. [Malloc](./0-malloc_checked.c)
2. [String Nconcat](./1-string_nconcat.c)
3. [Malloc and _Free](./2-calloc.c)
4. [Realloc](./3-array_range.c)
5. [We Must Accept Finite Disappointment, But Never Lose Infinite Hope](./100-realloc.c)
6. [Infinite Multiplication](./101-mul.c)
